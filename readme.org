#+title: ifupdown implementation in Org

(/Incomplete/)

The =ifupdown= source code used to be implemented in noweb style
up to [[https://bitbucket.org/ifupdown/ifupdown/commits/eb636614476b7f9af64620fe8f298d2f03abf7ce][this commit]].  I found the original implementation in noweb
interesting so this is an attempt at salvaging some of it using Org.
